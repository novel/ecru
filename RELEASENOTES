0.1.0 / Nov 8th, 2008

The first public release of ecru. Most likely contains a lot of bugs
since I seem to be the only person using it, though the code was 
available on github for a while, so I'm not sure.

So, generally it works and compiles fine here on FreeBSD box and at
work on my Ubuntu box. I use it as a main livejournal client for the
several months already and haven't had major problems with it, however,
I do not guarantee it will not harm your journal (however it should 
not :] ).

Anyway, if you have any problems or question, feel free to join
'ljecru' and write there:
