Bugs
-------------------------------
 * allowmask sometimes acts strange (almsk) (fixed I hope)
 * ecru-edit doesn't bring security field to the editor (edsec) (fixed)
 * ecru-edit -- -1 should replace '-1' with the actual id before submitting (edshct) (fixed)
 * revtime and revnum properties should be adjusted
   when submitting editted post (seem to happen on livejournal side???)

Nice to have
-------------------------------
 * Markdown support (implemented, needs testing)
 * Unit tests
   Figure out how to integrate unit test with waf in a nice way
 * Mutt-like headers configuration
 * Logging (lgng) (almsk kinda depends on it since it's useful for debugging) (implemented)
 * Footer like in svn, cvs, etc commit message editor, displaying stuff like
   current using profile and so on, the message will be ignored when sending a post.
   It should be configurable via config file
 * Prompt message like "is everything ok? a) yes b) back to editor" etc. Should be
   optional too
 * Add a tool like 'ecru' for stuff like showing version (instead of adding '-v' option
   to every ecru-* tool) and so on.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Release goals (or stoppers):

0.1.0: lgng (done) + alsmk (done) + edsec (done) + edshct (done)
