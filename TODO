Bugs
-------------------------------
 * allowmask sometimes acts strange (almsk)
 * revtime and revnum properties should be adjusted
   when submitting editted post (seem to happen on livejournal side???)

Nice to have
-------------------------------
 * Markdown support (implemented, needs testing)
 * Unit tests
   Figure out how to integrate unit test with waf in a nice way
 * Mutt-like headers configuration
 * Logging (lgng) (almsk kinda depends on it since it's useful for debugging)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Release goals:

1.0.0: lgng + alsmk
