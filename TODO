Bugs
-------------------------------
 * Defining properties with -Dprop doesn't work for some special props
   like 'security' (dprop) (done)

Nice to have
-------------------------------
 * Markdown support (implemented, needs testing)
 * Unit tests
   Figure out how to integrate unit test with waf in a nice way
 * Mutt-like headers configuration
 * Footer like in svn, cvs, etc commit message editor, displaying stuff like
   current using profile and so on, the message will be ignored when sending a post.
   It should be configurable via config file (ftr)
 * Prompt message like "is everything ok? a) yes b) back to editor" etc. Should be
   optional too
 * Add a tool like 'ecru' for stuff like showing version (instead of adding '-v' option
   to every ecru-* tool) and so on.
 * When calling 'ecru-edit' and then just closing the editor without making any changes,
   don't resubmut stuff, just ignore (blnkchng) (done)
 * LiveJournal supports reffering to latest post by pseudo id "-1" (e.g. in ecru-edit). It
   would be useful to extend it to support not only "-1", but "-N", i.e. "edit the post N posts
   back". Maybe it should be done with some prefix, e.g. "ecru-edit :-3", because if
   we stay with just "-3" user will have to execute it this way: "ecru-edit -- -3" because
   of getopt (nthpst)
