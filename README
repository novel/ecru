                             ECRU

Ecru is a command-line client for LiveJournal. Name 'ecru' has no
special meaning etc, however, it's somehow related to the French
verb 'ecrire' which means 'to write'.

Ecru hasn't got an own homepage yet and the source code is stored
on github: http://github.com/novel/ecru/tree.

Build system is based on scons (http://www.scons.org/), most likely
any Linux distro has it and it should be available through BSD ports
as well. To build ecru, you have to execute 'scons' in the project's
root directory. However, you'll have to install some dependencies:

  * libconfig++ (part of libconfig) 
      (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig.html)
  * glibmm
  * libiqxmlrpc (http://libiqxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/)

Alas, not all Linux distros include libconfig and libiqxmlrpc packages
so I provided links to these projects so you could compile it yourself.
